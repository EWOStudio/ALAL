# ALAL (Alicorn Again Launcher)

## This Is a Fork

This is a fork of a the original [Alicorn](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn) repository. See the original README there. The name **ALAL** stands for **AL**icorn **A**gain **L**auncher. 

## Disclaimer

**ALAL is not compatible with Alicorn Legacy.** The data file format is updated and containers have changed a lot. No backward compatibility is guaranteed.

Many packages of the original author is not possible to update in a few commits, they might get updated soon to avoid vulnerabilities, but with no warranty.

The fork is made to keep the software alive, not a follow-up or series. The updates are made out of good intentions, but still, with no warranty.

## Major Changes (Comparing To Alicorn)

We attempt to make ALAL a modern launcher with latest features integrated. Therefore we've made several changes to the dependencies and code. Naming some:

- No longer supports Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, macOS 10.13, 10.14.

- No longer supports 32-bit OS.

- Add support to aarch64 / arm64 architectures.

- Improve UI.

- Improve performance.

- Improve mod resolution system.

## Build (WIP)

We're still testing for a faster and more reliable approach to build the app. This involves an update to the updators and several related assets. We'll update the documentation once we've completed the tests.
